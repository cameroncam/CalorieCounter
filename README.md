# CalorieCounter
CalorieCounter is a lightweight app for Android that helps users set goals and meet them by tracking their daily calorie intake.


When the app is opened for the first time, the user is prompted for personal information (height, weight, age, etc) and a goal (lose weight, maintain weight, or gain weight) which is used to calculate their total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) and a calorie goal to meet each day based on their goal. 


Then, the user can input the food items they consume each day, lookup how many calories they contain through integration with the USDA database, and view statistics about their calorie intake and see whether or not they are meeting their goals.
